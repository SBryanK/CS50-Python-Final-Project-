#CS50 Pyhton

Hello folks, I just finished my Intro to Programming course from Harvard University CS50 course. This is my final project; a restaurant billing system algorithm that can automatically display the total amount of order you choose. 

In the practice, the code is  really easy to implement and understand.
There are menu items and its corresponding item price in dictionary form. Then the user will be asked to input any menu(index) they want to order. After the order is finished, you can see the total amount of bill automatically.

This code is the basic algorithm fof billing system, there are potential upgrade for coupon usage, real time payment gateway and more interactive web deployment
